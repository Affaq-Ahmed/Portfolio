title: The Athlete in Me — Lessons Sports Taught Me About Life
summary:
  Before becoming a developer, I was (and still am) an athlete. From cricket and
  football to table tennis and chess, sports have shaped my mindset, discipline,
  and resilience — the same traits I now carry into software development.

Sports have always been a big part of who I am.  
Before I ever wrote a single line of code, I was chasing a ball, sweating under
the sun, and learning lessons that no classroom could teach.

## The Beginning — Cricket at Age 4

I started playing and watching **cricket** when I was about **3–4 years old**.
It became my first love — and honestly, it still is.  
I began with **tape ball cricket**, which is where most of us in Pakistan learn
the basics: no pads, no crowd, just passion.  
Even today, whenever I find time, I still play. It’s my favorite way to
disconnect from the screen and reconnect with the energy that started it all.

## Football — The Team Spirit Game

In **6th grade**, I picked up **football**, and it quickly became my second
sport.  
I continued playing all the way through **university**, and it taught me
teamwork, patience, and how to keep moving forward even when the scoreboard
isn’t in your favor.  
Football helped me understand strategy and collaboration — lessons I later found
extremely useful in software projects and teamwork at work.

## Table Tennis — The Game That Stuck

During my **first year in college**, I discovered **table tennis**, and it has
stayed with me ever since.  
I even bought my own table at home when I landed my **first job at Tintash**,
playing regularly with my brother, **Ashan Ahmed**.  
Now, in my current office at **DevCache**, I still play it almost every day. It
keeps me active, competitive, and clear-headed — a great way to stay in shape
both mentally and physically.

## Other Sports — Always Up for a Challenge

I’ve also played **volleyball** from time to time and **badminton** for several
years.  
Badminton was a special one — I used to play with my **father (Malik Muhammad
Sher)** and my brother at home from **4th grade until my second year in
college**.  
Those family games weren’t just fun — they were bonding moments, and some of my
best memories come from there.

And of course, I’ve always loved **indoor games** too — from **Ludo** and
**Sequence** to **Chess**, which I’ve been playing seriously for the past
year.  
Chess, especially, has helped me sharpen my patience and problem-solving skills
— traits that mirror debugging code or designing backend logic.

## What Sports Taught Me

Looking back, every sport I played taught me something valuable:

- **Cricket** taught me patience.
- **Football** taught me teamwork.
- **Table Tennis** taught me focus and precision.
- **Badminton** taught me consistency.
- **Chess** taught me strategy and patience.

All in all, I’ve realized that I’m a **sportsman at heart** — someone who can
get into any sport and start improving within days.  
That adaptability translates directly into how I learn new technologies or
handle challenges as a developer.

## Closing Thoughts

Sports shaped my mindset long before coding ever did.  
The discipline, focus, and resilience I learned from years of playing — they’re
the same qualities that help me grow in my professional life today.

No matter how busy life gets, I’ll always make time to play. Because for me,
being a **developer** and being an **athlete** aren’t separate identities —
they’re just two sides of the same passion for improvement.
